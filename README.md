# SailthruMobileSwift

This package acts as a wrapper around the [Sailthru Mobile iOS SDK](https://github.com/carnivalmobile/carnival-ios-sdk) to allow the asynchronous functionality to be accessed using Swift Concurrency.

It can be added to a project as a Swift Package and will include the base SDK.

Due to version constraints on Concurrency, it is only available for iOS 13+ and Swift 5+.
